    <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>There are numerous apps on the app store now focused on mHealth. They offer a wide variety of tools for people suffering from many different issues. They are most effective when used frequently. The problem arises with app usage adherence and the positive effects of mHealth apps are largely negated as they are used less. If users aren’t using the apps as the designers intend or not at all, they do not receive the same benefits. You can see the vast drop off in the image bellow from, Owen, J., Jaworski, B., Kuhn, E., Makin-Byrd, K., Ramsey, K., & Hoffman, J. (n.d.).

    <h1>SOLUTION</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>The main goal of our app is to increase the usage of mHealth apps by targeting users with notifications to launch the app when they are most likely to be engaged. By increasing usage, we believe this will help the apps work more effectively.</p>

            <p>An application that tracks users and classifys good times to use the apps, such as when the user is not moving at home or at a certain time of day, and launches a notification for the user to use a mHealth app at those times.</p>

    <h1>OUR APP</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>Our app-GoHealthy works by constantly taking information from the user’s phone. It looks at the data from the accelerometer in both the X, Y, and Z directions. It also checks the screen state to determine whether the phone screen is currently on or off. Finally, it uses the current GPS location of the phone. In the event that the phone GPS is unavailable (such as when someone is underground or in some other non-reachable location), we have a default location programmed into the system. GoHealthy takes all this information and writes it into CSV files with the time stamp on the phone for easy processing once the data has been collected. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 description">
          <p> To get users' feedback, We built three buttons in GoHealthy: positive, negative and neutral. The user is asked to fill out this one-question survey after the app issues an alert, in order to collect data about which notifications are well-timed. </p>

          <p> With a welled-trained machine learning model, we can calssify good versus bad times for users to use these apps. GoHealthy will lanunch a notification to engage user open their mhealth app when it is the best time analysed by our model</p>

      <h1>RESULTS</h1>
      <hr/>
      <p>We found the best results when looking at the features mean, variance, and range when using boxcar and sliding window with K nearest neighbor. As you can see in the ROC curve bellow we acheived best results for good (class 2) and bad (class 0) times. Since our goal was to focus on classifying good versus bad times if we ignore the results for netural times we get the following ocnfusion matrix. As you can see it acheived fairly good results. Having precision values of 0.9615 and 0.8218 for class 0 and 2 respectively, recall values of 0.4717 and 0.9923 for class 0 and 2 respectively, and F1-Scores of 0.6329 and 0.8991 for class 0 and 2 respectively.</p>
